# AlertBox
A simply small program that allows a small box to be always on top.

When clicked gives a pop-up message and change colour.

In this case it has been programmed for an airport ground coordination office that need to have a clear memo to advise the control tower about the change of the situation in a precise stand.

Ideal for training of new personnel in high intensity input enviroments where communications are crucial.
